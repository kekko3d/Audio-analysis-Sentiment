# *Sentiment analysis against database of human voice audios*

This repository contains the final project from the course **[Data Science Lab: process and methods](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TWZSM&p_a_acc=2020&p_header=S&p_lang=EN&multi=N/)**. 

Course topics:

• Data science process: main phases
• Data collection, cleaning, transformation and enrichment and feature engineering
• Data mining algorithms: classification, regression, clustering, and association rule mining
• Introduction to Python and data mining and machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
• Case study analysis
• Data science process design in the lab


The project is aimed to perform a sentiment analysis on audio speech through different classification techniques. Both classic and more advanced machine
learning models are implemeted in order to recognize various speakers' moods. In particular, a preprocessing pipeline is implemented in order to enhance the most significant features of the dataset.
